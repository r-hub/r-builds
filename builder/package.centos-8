# Create post-install script required for OpenBLAS.
#
# On RHEL and SUSE, we link R against the internal shared BLAS to make the
# R binaries more portable and allow users to switch BLAS implementations without
# having to recompile R. We default to OpenBLAS, but users may prefer other implementations.
# 
# Binary packages built against the shared BLAS are also more portable and may be used
# with the default R distributed by RHEL/SUSE, or other R installations using
# shared BLAS and configured with a different BLAS (such as Microsoft R Open with MKL).
# This is especially important for Posit Package Manager's binary packages.
#
# However, as of R 4.2.3, EPEL 8's R no longer uses shared BLAS and now links to an
# external OpenBLAS (OpenMP). This means EPEL R no longer has a swappable BLAS and
# is no longer compatible with these R builds.
